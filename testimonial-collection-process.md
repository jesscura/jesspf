**Subject:** Quick favor - would you share your experience working together?

Hi [Client Name],

I hope you're doing well! It's been [timeframe] since we completed the [project type] project, and I wanted to check in on how things are going.

I'm working on updating my portfolio to better showcase the results I've achieved for clients like yourself. Would you be willing to share a brief testimonial about our work together?

**Quick Questions:**
1. What specific challenge were you facing before we started working together?
2. What was the most valuable outcome from our collaboration?
3. Would you recommend my services to other businesses? Why?
4. Any specific metrics or improvements you'd like to highlight? (e.g., time saved, efficiency gains, satisfaction scores)

Feel free to answer in any format - even a few sentences would be amazing!

Thanks so much for your time, and I hope we can work together again soon.

Best regards,
Jesel Cura

### Template 3: LinkedIn Connection Request
**Subject:** Request for LinkedIn recommendation

Hi [Client Name],

I hope this message finds you well! I'm reaching out to ask if you'd be comfortable providing a LinkedIn recommendation based on our work together on [specific project].

The [specific results achieved] we accomplished together really demonstrates the value of [your service area], and I think your perspective would be valuable for others considering similar services.

If you're open to it, I'd be happy to draft something for your review, or you can write it in your own words - whatever works best for you.

I'd also be glad to reciprocate with a recommendation for you if that would be helpful!

Thanks for considering it.
