# Profile Photo

Place your profile photo here as `jesel.jpg`.

Recommended:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 800–1200 px square (we render as a circle)
- Filename: `jesel.jpg`

Paths used in code:
- Primary: `/assets/imgs/profile/jesel.jpg`
- Fallback (already present): `/assets/imgs/profile/placeholder.svg`

How to update:
1. Export/crop your headshot to a square image.
2. Save as `jesel.jpg` and copy to this folder.
3. Commit and push to `main` — Vercel will auto‑deploy.

No code changes are needed as long as you keep the filename the same.
